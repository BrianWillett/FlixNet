## FlixNet


#### This is built to run in VS Code with the [BrightScript Language][1] extension
[1]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript/ "BrightScript Extension"

### What it is:

- This is a side project that I used to get more comfortable with Brightscript.  It is a Netflix type application that lists movies and allows the user to view the trailer for the movie (as the APIs used limit to just trailers).
- Utilizes the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/ "TMDB API") and [IMDB API](https://developer.imdb.com/ "IMDB API") to accomplish the movie lists and the trailer previews

### What it is not:

- This is not something to be monetized.
